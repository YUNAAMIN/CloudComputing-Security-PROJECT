# CloudComputing-Security-PROJECT

Project Overview:  
This project involves conducting a detailed case study on the secure migration of a 
fictional company's IT infrastructure to the cloud. Throughout the project, students will 
explore various aspects of cloud computing and data security, including definitions, 
security challenges, data protection mechanisms, and strategies for mitigating data 
breaches and vulnerabilities. 
Project explanation:  
The fictional company “TechSolutions Inc.” is a mid-sized technology company looking 
to migrate its on-premises IT infrastructure to the cloud to improve scalability, 
accessibility and cost-effectiveness. However, the company is concerned about the 
potential security risks associated with cloud adoption and wants to ensure data 
security. 
You work in the IT department of a giant company like Google, Microsoft, or Azure, and 
you have been asked to create a proposal for this company, TechSolutions Inc. With a 
product available in one of these giant companies. You must give a complete proposal 
explaining all the features and services provided by the cloud company you work for. 
Also, this proposal must explain some security flaws and vulnerabilities that could cause 
data breaches. Finally, a security strategy must be developed to solve all these security 
vulnerabilities using appropriate security countermeasures for each vulnerability. 
Then you should cover the following in your project: 
1- 
Understanding Cloud Computing Definitions: Select one of these giant 
companies and explain critical characteristics and different cloud service and 
deployment models. Analyze how cloud computing aligns with TechSolutions 
Inc.’s business objectives and IT requirements. 
2- 
Assessing Cloud Computing Security: Identify security risks and challenges 
associated with cloud computing and explain three security vulnerabilities 
that cause those risks. Discuss the shared responsibility model and the roles 
of cloud service providers and clients in ensuring security. Finally, evaluate 
security measures provided by your cloud company and their suitability for 
TechSolutions Inc.’s needs. 
3- 
4- 
Implementing Data Security in Cloud Computing: Develop a data security 
strategy for TechSolutions Inc.’s cloud data processing, considering at least 
three data security requirements: privacy, confidentiality, integrity, 
authentication, authorization, accountability and availability. Discuss the 
importance of data classification and lifecycle management in maintaining 
data security. Explore cloud-native security services and tools for securing 
data in the cloud environment. 
Address data breaches, vulnerabilities, and security requirements: 
Summarize your security proposal using a flowchart. Firstly, it identifies data 
breaches and potential vulnerabilities that may arise in the cloud. Second, it 
develops security requirements and policies specifically designed for 
TechSolutions Inc.’s cloud environment. Finally, security controls and 
countermeasures are implemented to mitigate identified risks.
